			The choice of surgeon for your procedure is the most important decision you will make and it is extremely important that you research the qualifications of your surgeon before you commit to a decision.

			<br>
			In Australia any doctor can practise cosmetic surgery, regardless of whether or not they have had any appropriate or advanced surgical training.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons strictly recommends that all surgery be performed by appropriately qualified surgeons. It takes 10 years plus of specialist training and examinations to gain the specialist qualification of being a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. To retain that qualification, surgeons must submit to annual audit to ensure that they continue to meet appropriate standards. The Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) is a specialist society that deals with the administration of plastic surgery in this country. The Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery is an association that is an educational body that continues and promotes post graduate education in aesthetic plastic surgery. Only fully qualified plastic surgeons are eligible to become members of these societies.
